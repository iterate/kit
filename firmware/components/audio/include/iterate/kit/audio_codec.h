/**
 * Hardware facts which affect composition but do not size shared queues.
 *
 * These values describe the physical codec path after its adapter has applied
 * any fixed conversion. Wire-frame sizes, queue depths, and timeouts remain in
 * voice_device_profile.h so every board is supervised against one table. A
 * board adapter must not copy those supervision constants into this struct.
 *
 * `has_reference_channel` means read() returns a capture-clock-aligned
 * loudspeaker reference, not merely a copy of intended TX PCM. A true value
 * does not by itself prove acoustic alignment or cancellation quality; those
 * require board-specific evidence.
 *
 * Four more facts were advertised here and never asked for:
 * `full_duplex`, `capture_is_echo_cancelled`, and the two
 * `*_clock_is_hardware_owned` flags. Every board filled them in and no caller
 * ever branched on one, so all four said only what their board's own header
 * already says in prose. A property nobody reads is a claim nobody checks.

/**
 * Nonblocking hardware operations owned by one audio task.
 *
 * read() copies the oldest retained complete capture-clock-contiguous samples
 * and returns UNAVAILABLE when no frame is ready. An overrun may discard older
 * samples before this call, but a successful read never skips a retained frame.
 * `reference` must be non-NULL exactly when the properties advertise a
 * reference channel. `capacity_samples` counts int16_t entries in each plane,
 * not bytes; multi-channel capture is interleaved within the capture plane.
 * A successful read returns 1..capacity_samples entries and fully writes
 * `sample_count`. The public iterate_kit_audio_codec_read() wrapper initializes
 * it and overwrites any adapter residue so every non-OK result observed by a
 * caller leaves the pointed value at zero.
 *
 * write() copies one complete playback plane or returns BACKPRESSURE.
 * `sample_count` uses the same int16_t-entry convention; an adapter returns
 * INVALID_ARGUMENT for unsupported granularity and UNAVAILABLE when playback
 * is disabled. A successful copy is admission to the bounded hardware path,
 * not proof of physical playout. Platform diagnostics own that later
 * completion evidence. Neither operation allocates, waits, calls the network,
 * or silently drops.
 *
 * The composition root must match capture rate and frame cadence to its audio
 * processor and may select a reference-requiring processor only when
 * `has_reference_channel` is true. Those are configuration errors, not
 * recoverable per-frame outcomes.
