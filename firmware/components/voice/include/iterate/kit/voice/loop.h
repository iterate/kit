/*
 * THE ONE PROGRAM EVERY ITERATE VOICE BOARD RUNS.
 *
 * Four boards shipped four copies of it. They were not merely similar: with
 * board prefixes normalised, the Waveshare and M5Stick capture tasks were
 * IDENTICAL — 46 lines, nothing differing — `on_speaker_pcm` differed by two or
 * three lines across all four, and `now_ms`, `initialise_rings`,
 * `playback_apply_reprime`, `on_session_ended`, `clock_slug`, `start_clock_once`
 * and `append_stats` were byte-equivalent once renamed. Of ~1,700 lines per
 * device file, ~110 touched a board-specific symbol.
 *
 * The cost was not the duplication. It was that every bug had to be found four
 * times, and several times was not: the missing disarm in the flush funnel, the
 * playout reset a new call needs, the liveness clock a never-ready transport
 * could hold open forever, the launch diagnostics that answer "why did that
 * press not become a call" — each was fixed on one board and left standing on
 * the rest for weeks. Two boards still carried a `park_with_fault` that
 * `return`ed instead, which with the watchdog already subscribed is a reboot
 * loop the file's own comment warns about.
 *
 * WHAT THE LOOP KEEPS, because it is policy rather than hardware: turn taking
 * (push-to-talk against server VAD), the half-duplex fence and its ordering, the
 * playout timeline, every watchdog and every retry ladder.
 *
 * WHAT THE BOARD OWNS: pixels, buttons, amplifiers, servos, cameras, and the
 * audio codec itself.
