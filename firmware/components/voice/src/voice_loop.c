 * orders. Two disarmed the starvation watch AFTER taking the audio away, two
 * never disarmed at all, and one was right. On 2026-08-04 the wrong ordering
 * cost the acceptance run at 5/10: the bridge had raced 13,020ms ahead, the
 * hang-up arrived with the ring that deep, and `spkStarveEvents` — the
 * never-tier gate — recorded a starvation the device had caused on purpose.
 *
 * Keep these five effects together. The ordering is the correctness proof:
 * disarm -> note flush -> invalidate -> discard -> reprime. In particular,
 * invalidating before disarming creates a window in which an intentional cut
 * is counted as listener-visible starvation. ESP-IDF 5.4.2's
 * FreeRTOS-Kernel-SMP/queue.c:xQueueGenericReset holds the queue lock and leaves
 * blocked receivers waiting when an existing queue is reset. A frame copied

     * at the user, and sends every word into a void for hours.
     *
     * THE EVIDENCE IS AN ANSWERED ROUND TRIP, of which there are two kinds and
     * either will do.
     *
     * An ANSWERED `whoami()` PROBE is the stronger one: the mount asks the
     * session once a period (itx_mount.h) and an answer proves the session,
     * the socket and the hop in one. A WEBSOCKET PONG is the weaker fallback,
     * and it is what covers the window where the transport is ready but no
     * mount exists yet — the only window on this device that is genuinely quiet.
     *
     * KEYING ON THE PONG ALONE WAS A RACE. The transport originates its PING
     * only after inbound silence (websocket_connection.c), and an answered probe
     * IS inbound traffic on the same period — so a healthy mounted board could
     * suppress every PING it needed and reboot itself at 420 s on a good
     * network. Reading the probe answers here removes the race without a second
     * constant: a mounted board is kept alive by its probes, an unmounted one by
     * its PONGs, and neither has to win a timing argument with the other.
     *
     * WHY NOT ANY INBOUND APPLICATION SIGNAL: delivery batches and served
     * dispatches both stop on a perfectly healthy IDLE board, so re-keying on
     * them would restart every idle device on a timer. The mount watchdog made
     * exactly that mistake; the note in voice_device_profile.h is what it cost.
     * A probe answer and a PONG both keep arriving on an idle board, which is
     * the whole point.
     *
     * NEITHER IS DELIVERY CREDIT. They prove the hop is alive and nothing more —
     * the rule at iterate_kit_websocket_tx_queue_control is unchanged and this
