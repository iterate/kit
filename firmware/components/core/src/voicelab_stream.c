 * THE UPLINK MU-LAW ENCODER WAS HERE, AND WHY IT MIGHT HAVE TO COME BACK.

 * It was removed deliberately: two codecs on one wire is two chances for the
 * ends to disagree, and they did — a server that read the bytes as PCM16 while
 * the device sent mu-law produced a call that heard nothing, answered nothing
 * and logged nothing. PCM16 both ways deletes that whole class of fault.
 *
 * What it cost is on record and is NOT theoretical. Before mu-law, a 3-second
 * turn put roughly 100 KB/s of base64 PCM16 on the wire in one burst and the
 * TCP flow stalled dead — both directions, no errors, twenty seconds at a
 * time. That is the "I hold the button and nothing happens" this lab spent
 * days on. Halving the bytes fixed it, and also quartered the message rate,
 * because twice as many frames fit one append.
 *
 * So the uplink is back to where that happened. A host CLI on a wired network
 * will never show it; only a board on Wi-Fi can. If the stall returns, this is
 * the first thing to put back, and `git log` has the exact encoder.

 * over them to work out for itself whether the audio was still wanted:
 * high-water marks, abandoned-answer latches, restart detection, duplicate
 * rejection. Three separate bugs in it silenced the device PERMANENTLY — each
 * one a number the sender could never reach again — and all three were found
 * by listening to a board go quiet and then guessing. It was answering a
 * question the sender already knows the answer to.
 *
 * The sender says `drop` instead, on the first chunk of a replacing answer.
 * It cannot be reordered against the audio it invalidates because it IS that
 * audio, and there is nothing left to get wrong.
 *
 * DEDUPLICATION IS NOT DONE HERE EITHER. A make-before-break recycle really
 * does deliver the same events twice, and that is handled one layer up by
 * event OFFSET (`dispatch_batch`), which is where the identity of an event
 * actually lives. Doing it again by audio content was a second answer to the
