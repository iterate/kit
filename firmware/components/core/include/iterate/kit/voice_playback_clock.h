/*
 * Shared playout-clock policy; it owns no ring, clock, task, or audio device.
 *
 * The producer decides what to queue — which is now nothing at all, because
 * the sender paces the answer and marks the chunk that replaces one.  This
 * module answers the separate realtime question at each 20 ms sink tick: wait
 * for opening prefill, play, conceal a mid-answer hole, or discard one late
 * frame to bound excessive backlog.  That question is about occupancy, which
 * is local to the consumer and knowable nowhere else.
 *
 * There was a fifth answer, DROP_DEBT: one frame discarded per frame
 * concealed, so concealment could not permanently add its own duration to
 * playout lag.  Nothing ever incurred the debt — `drop_debt_frames` was only
 * ever zeroed and decremented, never incremented — so the branch, its counter
 * and the five device arms that read it were unreachable from the day they
 * were written.  DROP_CATCHUP is what actually bounds lag.
 *
 * One playback owner mutates this structure.  Calls are allocation-free and
 * non-blocking; `now_ms` is monotonic milliseconds and `queued_bytes` excludes
 * the candidate frame already removed from the ring.
