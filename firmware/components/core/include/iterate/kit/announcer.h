/*
 * WHAT THE BOARD SAYS OUT LOUD, AND WHEN.
 *
 * A board that is offline or still connecting is otherwise silent, and most
 * have no screen: nobody can tell "joining Wi-Fi" from "wrong password" from
 * "iterate refused the key". The announcer turns connection facts and control
 * edges into phrases; the voice loop renders and plays them
 * (iterate/kit/tinyvoice.h). Pure policy: no clock, audio or platform of its own.
 *
 * - A boot someone caused (power, the reset button, USB) is narrated until it
 *   connects. Each connection state that lasts a second is said, once, for at
 *   most three minutes. A boot nobody watched (an update, a crash, a watchdog)
 *   is not: no singing at 3 am.
 * - Once connected, drops are silent.
 * - A wake word gets "Hello!" when connected, and the reason it cannot talk
 *   when not. So does a button press while not connected. Only while the
 *   speaker is free, so the answer starts at once; otherwise the board chimes.
 * - A session's end gets "Call ended." in the same voice.
 * - Narration waits while a session is open or opening: the microphone is live.
 * - One phrase at a time: the loop takes the next phrase only when its speaker
 *   is free, so a phrase never cuts off another. A phrase waiting for the
 *   speaker is about the state it was queued for: narration of a state that
 *   has passed is dropped, and an answer follows the state.
