# Jonas's test devices

Identified on 2026-09-21. Use the ROM MAC / USB serial number as identity;
`/dev/cu.usbmodem*` paths can change after reconnecting a device.

| Device                                       | ROM MAC / USB serial | Evidence                                                                                                 |

| Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition (HAVPE) | `D8:3B:DA:46:20:34`  | Serial boot identifies `iterate-kit-havpe`, XMOS 1.3.1 and this Wi-Fi MAC.                               |
| Satellite1                                   | `14:C1:9F:4F:D2:14`  | Previously identified during recovery; see [bench notes](bench-notes.md#satellite1-rom-recovery-record). |

Waveshare ESP32-S3 RLCD 4.2 has USB serial `94:A9:90:CD:51:B8`.
Factory boot reported `03_Fac`, ES8311/ES7210 and the vendor's RLCD wiring;
Jonas confirmed the Hello World display and KEY-button test on this unit.
See its [board notes](devices/waveshare_s3_rlcd/README.md).

ZECTRIX NOTE4 has USB serial `80:45:6B:38:60:84`. Factory boot identifies
`zectrix-s3-epaper-4.2`, xiaozhi 3.6.2. Its full factory backup and current
firmware are documented in [NOTE4 board notes](devices/zectrix_note4/README.md).

Resolve a device's current port passively from the repository root:

```sh
apps/kit/firmware/tools/port-for-mac.sh D8:3B:DA:46:20:34
```

`esptool read_mac` and serial monitors can reset a board. Identify it through
USB metadata before opening its port; leave other attached devices alone.

The HAVPE targets `https://os.iterate2.com`, project slug `prj-kit-bench`,
canonical project ID `prj_3afc6e86c9202218ef3c6b7059e5be82`. Its provisioning
uses the canonical ID and a project-scoped personal access token for the
existing `kit-bench@iterate.com` bench account. Credentials belong in the
provisioning partition, never in this file.

On 2026-09-21, its old grant authenticated but reached no projects; serial
reported `project get rejected`. The current bench project also lacked
`itx.voice`. Repair required renewing the device grant against the canonical
project ID and installing the voice service in that project.

Reflashed that day from `ddaf396ff` (firmware matches `origin/main` at
`97ffd6fd6`), with the voice service from `97ffd6fd6`. All 64 firmware host
tests passed. The air-path check opened a call in 2.97 seconds, transcribed
“Hello voice assistant, please say banana, just the word banana” and played
“Banana.” with no reported errors.

Satellite1 was also rebuilt and reflashed on 2026-09-21. Its saved configuration
still pointed at `https://os.iterate.com` and retired project
`prj_7d0fb56f09a54a298e3ddfb106c1fb9a`; it now uses the same canonical bench
project at `https://os.iterate2.com`, with its own project-scoped grant.
Flash hashes and all 64 host tests passed. The voice check opened a call in
2.47 seconds and returned “Hello? Banana.”; an interruption check stopped
its counting and returned “Stopped.” Both checks reported no errors, and
final health showed an idle call, ready transport, XMOS 1.0.3 and an unmuted mic.

## Bench website backend repair — 2026-09-21

- Website: https://prj-kit-bench.iterate2.app
- `itx.whoami()` now exposes the actual project slug and public URL to agents.
- Config repository: `/repos/config`, with `worker.ts` and publication instructions in `README.md`.
- Apex routing uses the explicit `project/ingress-configured` worker target; source reads and cache keys pin the same Git commit.
- The September 21 failed update had written a repo and ingress event while production still used the old router. Its source also contained a TypeScript annotation unsupported by the JavaScript worker loader. Both were corrected.
- Voice prompts require probing worker code and fetching the public page before claiming success. Firmware and USB devices were not changed for this backend repair.
- Physical HAVPE call at 11:16:28 UTC successfully requested the chicken-joke update. The final deployed backend independently repeated publication and live HTTP verification, and returned the exact hostname on a fresh follow-up. The website was left showing the user's chicken joke.

## Satellite1 OTA proof — 2026-09-21

`itx.clients.satellite1.system.update({url, sha256})` successfully installed the
1,283,664-byte Satellite1 app over Wi-Fi (SHA-256
`ff3a2fb771880a95808079b5805a296d237cf8c63e5d5788719ca792d78b92a5`).
The download was staged through `itx.files` with a one-hour signed URL and
independently hash-checked before calling the updater. Acceptance returned
`true`; the device disappeared briefly, then reconnected within 20 seconds
with lower uptime and `restartNote: "system-update"`. A subsequent health
check confirmed increasing uptime/capture counts, ready transport, a 20 V PD
contract, and zero protocol, codec, amplifier or PD failures. No USB was used.
The temporary remote file was removed. Evidence is retained locally under
`.build/satellite-ota-2026-09-21/`; no post-update voice conversation was tested.
