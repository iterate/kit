 * NS remains the unqualified production default. A release experiment may
 * select another cumulative XMOS tap in a separate build directory, but the
 * choice must be a compiler-visible build input: editing this source between
 * flashes made retained evidence impossible to attribute and made accidental
 * production drift too easy. The numeric values are the XMOS wire contract
 * mirrored by the public enum below, so reject an out-of-range cache value at
 * compile time rather than sending an invented command to hardware.

/*
 * NS (3), AND THE DRIFT TO 1 IS A CAUTIONARY TALE. The long comment below
 * argues honestly for the AEC tap from bench windows — and a real
 * conversation falsified it TWICE: first the production run it records
 * ("the first short reply leaked through the AEC tap nearly unchanged"),
 * and then again live on 2026-08-19, when a stage-1 build reached a
 * physical board mid-conversation and the board's own oracle read
 * echoRawPeak 8509 against echoCleanPeak 8514 — the "cancelled" uplink as
 * loud as the raw microphone, and the listener heard nothing but double
 * talk. The hardware-config test pins THIS number; the day it goes red
 * against this file, the test is the side that is right.
