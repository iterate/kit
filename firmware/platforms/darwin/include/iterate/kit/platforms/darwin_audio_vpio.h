/*
 * iterate_kit_darwin_audio_vpio: this Mac's microphone AND speaker through one
 * Apple VoiceProcessingIO unit, so macOS cancels the speaker out of the
 * microphone before the stack ever sees it.
 *
 * ORIGINATING FAILURE. With a plain capture queue beside a plain playback
 * queue there is no echo cancellation anywhere, and the full-duplex model on
 * the far end hears its own answer coming back through the room. Measured on
 * this Mac (2026-09-11, unattended driver, real speaker and microphone): a
 * count to one hundred stopped at "One. Two. Three." and a two-minute story
 * died after one sentence and restarted with "Sure," — the model took its own
 * voice for a person interrupting. On the raw wire the same echo, fed back
 * digitally, was tolerated but transcribed as the USER's words, which is the
 * quieter failure: the durable transcript, the facet's forwarding of "what
 * the person said since", and the backend's context all fill with the
 * model's own speech.
 *
 * WHY ONE UNIT. Echo cancellation needs the render signal as its reference,
 * so capture and playback must go through the same processing graph; that is
 * what `kAudioUnitSubType_VoiceProcessingIO` is (FaceTime and every browser
 * on macOS run it). Both directions still land in the SAME rings the queue
 * path uses — `iterate_kit_darwin_audio_input` pushed from the unit's input
 * callback, `iterate_kit_darwin_audio_output` pulled from its render callback
 * — so the codec adapter, the metrics and every consumer are unchanged.
 *
 * FORMAT. The client format on both buses is the wire's own 16 kHz mono
 * PCM16; the unit converts from the devices' native rates. If the unit is
 * unavailable or refuses the format, open fails cleanly and the caller falls
 * back to the queues — an escape hatch that is also `--no-aec` on the CLI.
