/*
 * iterate_kit_darwin_audio_output: the CoreAudio speaker, as a converter that PULLS.
 *
 * ORIGINATING FAILURE. This module used to push: the loop handed each played
 * frame straight into one of eight preallocated AudioQueue buffers, and a
 * full set was reported as ERR_FULL. Eight 20 ms buffers is 160 ms of lead
 * and nothing else. A producer that ran even slightly ahead filled them and
 * had the remainder REFUSED — and the caller discarded that refusal with a
 * cast — after which the queue drained and played nothing until the next
 * burst. A whole conversation arrived as fragments separated by silence,
 * while the WAV beside it recorded the same audio perfectly and the `played`
 * counter climbed at exactly fifty frames a second. The recording was clean,
 * the counters were clean, and the room was silent.
 *
 * THE SHAPE THAT FIXES IT. Hardware does not accept audio when the software
 * feels like offering it; it demands audio on its own clock and takes silence
 * when nobody has any. So the queue is primed at open and every buffer is
 * refilled and re-enqueued from CoreAudio's own callback, pulling from a ring
 * this module owns. Playback therefore never stops once started, a producer
 * running ahead is ABSORBED by the ring rather than refused, and a producer
 * running behind produces countable silence instead of a stalled queue.
 *
 * This is also what the device does. The ESP32's I2S peripheral pulls from a
 * DMA descriptor chain on the codec's clock; the host now models the same
 * relationship rather than an unrelated push protocol, which is the whole
 * premise of running the device's code here.
 * Apple documents Audio Queue Services as automatically supplying the
 * appropriate converter for its requested PCM format:
 * https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/CoreAudioEssentials/CoreAudioEssentials.html
 *
 * OWNERSHIP AND THREADS. Exactly two threads touch this: the cooperative loop
 * calls write, and CoreAudio's internal thread calls the callback. They meet
 * only at the ring, which is single-producer single-consumer with atomic
 * indices. Nothing allocates after open and nothing blocks, because blocking
 * the loop to feed a speaker would stall the transport that fills it.
