/*
 * iterate_kit_darwin_audio_input: this Mac's microphone ring.
 *
 * ORIGINATING FAILURE. The target's only microphone was a WAV file, so nobody
 * could talk to the stack by hand. Every turn was a recording, and a recording
 * cannot interrupt, cannot pause mid-sentence, and cannot tell you the answer
 * came back sounding wrong. Whole classes of complaint had to wait for a board
 * to be flashed before anybody could hear them.
 *
 * IT IS A SOURCE, NOT A SECOND PATH. The Darwin codec adapter drains this ring
 * only through audio_codec.read(); its caller then applies the selected audio
 * processor and the same microphone queue and talk gate used by a file source.
 * A live-microphone path that reached the uplink some other way would prove
 * nothing about the device and would be the first thing to drift.
 *
 * CONCURRENCY. CoreAudio fills buffers on its own capture thread and calls
 * back there; the cooperative poll owner drains. One producer, one consumer,
 * no locks: the producer only ever advances `write`, and `read` belongs to the
 * consumer alone. On overrun the CONSUMER discards the oldest frames and
 * counts them, which is the portable microphone queue's policy for the same
 * reason — a
 * queue that keeps the oldest speech sends a sentence that falls further
 * behind the speaker with every frame.
 *
 * A slot of headroom is kept between the two: the consumer never reads the
 * frame the producer is in the middle of writing, so a lap costs whole old
 * frames rather than one torn one, which would be a click.
 *
 * FORMAT. 16 kHz mono PCM16, converted by CoreAudio from whatever the default
 * input device runs at. Anything else would be a different device under test.
 * Apple documents Audio Queue Services as automatically supplying the
 * appropriate converter for its requested PCM format:
 * https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/CoreAudioEssentials/CoreAudioEssentials.html
 * macOS gates microphone access: a process without permission is started
 * successfully and simply never receives a callback, so `captured` is the only
 * way to tell a denied prompt from a quiet room.

   * cold transport connect this ring would have grown with it — so a press

   *

   * missing its turn while CoreAudio keeps filling. Beyond that it only delays
