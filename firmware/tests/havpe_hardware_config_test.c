/**
 * These literal vectors are copied from the first-party ESPHome AIC3204 and
 * voice_kit implementations, not derived from the production table under
 * test. A swapped register or invented pipeline tap can still produce audio,
 * but it invalidates volume/AEC evidence in ways an acoustic smoke test cannot
 * localise. A physical full-duplex run at +24 dB reproduced the assistant's
 * own speech almost verbatim on the supposedly clean microphone and repeatedly
 * triggered server VAD. The 0 dB register values below therefore protect an
 * unclipped electrical reference and acoustic path; loudness must be raised
 * only after measured AEC headroom, never by silently changing this vector.

 * THIS TEST IS THE ORACLE'S GUARD, AND IT HAS EARNED THE JOB TWICE. It
 * asserts the NS tap because NS is the only stage a REAL CONVERSATION has
 * ever endorsed: the corrected campaign measured 0.982 matched-path
 * similarity, 0.901 under double-talk, three clean server-VAD starts and
 * no speaker-echo turn. The AEC tap's bench windows look better and its
 * conversations are worse — the recorded production run leaked the first
 * short reply nearly unchanged, and on 2026-08-19 a stage-1 build that
 * slipped past this very test (the assertion was "corrected" to match the
 * drifted code instead of the code corrected to match it) reached a
 * physical board and read echoRawPeak 8509 vs echoCleanPeak 8514
 * mid-conversation: cancellation of nothing, heard as double talk. When
 * this assertion disagrees with board/codecs/aic3204.c, the FIX IS IN
 * THE CONFIG, and the evidence standard for moving it is the board's own
 * oracle (`voicelab aec --stages`, health's echoRawPeak/echoCleanPeak) on
 * a live conversation — never a bench window, never this file.
