/*
 * M5StickS3 — what makes this board this board.
 *
 * The program it runs is components/voice/src/voice_loop.c, and it is the same
 * program the other three run. What is left here is the hardware: a 240x135
 * status screen, two buttons, an ES8311, and the one structural novelty this
 * board has — the HALF-DUPLEX FENCE.
 *
 * THE FENCE IS PHYSICS, NOT POLICY. The microphone is the same codec's ADC
 * driven on I2S1, sharing MCLK/BCLK/WS (GPIO 18/17/15) with the I2S0 speaker
 * path — two masters on one set of pins. Capture therefore requires DELETING
 * the playback channel, so the microphone cannot run while the speaker does
 * even if the firmware wanted it to. On a board with no AEC that is the whole
 * echo story, and it is why turns here are push-to-talk.
 *
 * The loop owns the SEQUENCING of that fence (marker on the wire -> speaker
 * queue empty -> pins), because the ordering is a correctness argument rather
 * than a driver detail. This file owns only the asking and the answering.
