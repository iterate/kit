 * one set of pins. Capture therefore requires DELETING the playback channel
 * (ESP-IDF leaves MCLK routed after a mere disable), and playback requires
 * the microphone to be fully released first. M5Unified owns the microphone;
 * this adapter owns I2S0, the codec's playback registers, and the M5PM1
 * amplifier latch.
 *
