/*
 * M5Stack CoreS3 "StackChan" — what makes this board this board.
 *
 * The program it runs is components/voice/src/voice_loop.c, and it is the same
 * program the other three run. What is left here is the hardware: a face on a
 * 320x240 panel, a touch screen that opens the provider menu, a PMIC side
 * button that speaks the session grammar (stackchan_modes.c — wake with a
 * chime, every end says "call ended"), a head on two servos, a camera, and —
 * the one structural novelty — a SOFTWARE echo canceller with three
 * different frame sizes behind it.
 *
 * THE CADENCES ARE THE INTERESTING PART. The codec completes 8 ms DMA chunks,
 * esp-sr's VOIP engine is fixed at 16 ms and fails closed if told otherwise,
 * and the wire wants 20 ms. Three numbers that do not divide into each other,
 * which is why this board is the reason the shared capture step goes through
 * `aec_capture_bridge` at all. Two facts express the whole of it now —
 * `capture_chunk_samples = 128` and `processing_frame_samples = 256` — and the
 * loop owns the conversion, so the fail-closed silence rule lives in one place
 * instead of being restated here.
 *
 * Turn taking is the PROVIDER'S, on the strength of that canceller: the
 * microphone rides the open call and server VAD segments turns. A recorded
 * divergence from decision A2, and the right one — push-to-talk's rationale is
 * the echo story on boards WITHOUT cancellation, and gating this microphone
 * would defeat the ported AEC's entire purpose.
 *
 * The status STRINGS go to the console log rather than the screen: the face
 * owns the glass and a semantic snapshot owns the rail, so there is nowhere a
 * sentence would go. Opening the USB console reboots this board, which is why
 * `health()` and `screen.take()` exist.
