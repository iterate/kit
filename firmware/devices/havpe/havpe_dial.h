 * the same arithmetic fed by polling instead of edges: the app loop samples
 * the two pins every pass (~5 ms), which tracks a human hand comfortably,
 * and a violent spin that outruns the sampling merely loses counts rather
 * than inventing them, because only adjacent Gray-code transitions count.
