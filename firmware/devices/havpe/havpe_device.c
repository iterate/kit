/*
 * Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition — what makes this board this board.
 *
 * The program it runs is components/voice/src/voice_loop.c, and it is the same
 * program the other three run. What is left here is the hardware: a 12-pixel
 * WS2812 ring that is the ENTIRE display, one centre button, an always-on
 * speaker rail, and an XMOS DSP doing echo cancellation in silicon.
 *
 * Turn taking is the PROVIDER'S, and that is a consequence of the XMOS rather
 * than a preference. This board is genuinely full duplex, so its microphone
 * stays open for the whole call and server VAD decides where turns end. It was
 * push-to-talk until somebody tried to talk to it: the call came up, the ring
 * showed one dim pixel meaning "call up, nobody listening", and speaking did
 * nothing, because the microphone only opened while a finger held the button.
 * Push-to-talk's rationale is the echo story on boards WITHOUT cancellation,
 * and this is the one board that has it in hardware.
 *
 * ITS XMOS AEC GETS NO VTABLE ENTRY, deliberately. Cancellation has already
 * happened by the time a sample reaches the ESP32, so the composition is
 * `audio_processor_passthrough` plus the codec's own
 * `capture_is_echo_cancelled` property — the two facts the loop needs, both
 * already expressible. A board op would have been a third spelling of them.
 *
 * `aec.setStage` IS here, because it is not the canceller: it is a handle on
 * the XMOS output taps, and it exists because an echo canceller cannot be
 * argued about, only measured — which means putting the SAME microphone on
 * both output channels, one raw and one cancelled, without a rebuild.
 *
 * Opening the USB console resets this board, which is why `health()` exists
 * and why the stats line is the instrument of record. There is no screen to
 * read anything off: if a method is not named in `instructions`, the only way
 * to find out this device can do it is to read this file.
