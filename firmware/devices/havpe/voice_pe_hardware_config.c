   * AEC, WITH A FIXED GAIN AFTER IT — because the choice between the taps is a
   * choice between two ways of being wrong, and only one of them is fixable
   * with a constant.
   *
   * Measured against the real provider, two turns each, question asked out
   * loud into the room (`voicelab aec --real --stages N`):
   *
   *   tap 4 AGC : room floor -39 dBFS, echo +22 dB over it. x.ai HEARD ITSELF
   *               and cancelled its own answer 5.6 s into a count to forty.
   *   tap 3 NS  : room floor -110 dBFS, echo +25 dB over it.
   *   tap 1 AEC : room floor  -83 dBFS, echo +1.0 dB over it — the echo sits
   *               AT the room floor, and whisper hears nothing of the answer.
   *
   * So the canceller works and the AGC undoes it. An automatic gain has to
   * raise quiet passages to hit its target, and between the assistant's words
   * the only thing there IS to raise is the residue; the ratio that separates
   * a person from an echo is exactly what it spends. The device then reports
   * its own voice to a detector that cannot know better, and the answer stops
   * mid-word.
   *
   * A FIXED gain cannot do that. It moves the person and the residue by the
   * same number of decibels, so the 30-odd dB between them at tap 1 survives
   * intact; all it changes is that both land somewhere a provider's detector
   * can see. That is the whole reason the constant below is a constant and
   * must never become adaptive, ducked, or gated — every previous attempt to
   * make it clever is what deleted the customer.
   *
   * The vendor ships tap 4 because it ships with wake-word-then-listen, where
   * the microphone is not open while the speaker runs and the AGC never has to
   * choose. Open-mic full duplex is a different problem and needs the tap
   * underneath.
   *
   * XMOS exposes cumulative taps in the order AEC -> IC -> NS -> AGC, and the
   * shipping Home Assistant Voice PE configuration selects AGC on channel 0
   * and NS on channel 1 (esphome/components/voice_kit/__init__.py:86-90). It
   * then feeds channel 0 to the assistant with `noise_suppression_level: 0`,
   * `auto_gain: 0 dbfs`, `volume_multiplier: 1` (home-assistant-voice.yaml
   * :1804-1807) — no host-side processing of any kind, because the tap is
   * already the finished thing.
   *
   * The AGC stage is not a loudness knob bolted on the end. It is the only
   * stage that receives the AEC's own opinion of the frame
   * (modules/audio_pipelines/reference/fixed_delay/audio_pipeline_t0.c
   * :124-131): `aec_ref_power` says how loud the far end is, `aec_corr_factor`
   * says how much of what the microphone hears correlates with it, and
   * `vnr_flag` says whether a voice is present at all. `AGC_PROFILE_ASR` uses
   * those three to hold gain down while the residue is ours and let it up
   * while a person is talking. That is echo-aware level control, tuned against
   * this microphone array by the people who built it.
   *
   * Stopping at NS discards it, and this device then reimplemented it badly in
   * userspace three times over: a fixed x16 make-up gain standing in for the
   * level target, a duck to x1 during playback standing in for loss control,
   * and an absolute barge-in floor with a memset standing in for the
   * correlation test. Each of the three has a comment explaining why it is
   * needed; each is needed only by the one before it; none of them can see
   * `aec_corr_factor`, so none can tell echo from a person except by loudness,
   * and by loudness a person two feet away loses. All three are deleted.
   *
   * The previous note here recorded a production run in which AGC "expanded
   * quiet speaker residue by roughly two orders of magnitude and retriggered
   * server VAD". That run had the x16 make-up gain downstream of it, so the
   * measured expansion is at least partly ours, and it read the tap through a
   * gate that was deleting frames. The experiment is not evidence about AGC
   * and is not treated as any; the board's own raw/cancelled oracle decides.
   *
   * The corrected IC experiment held the control and double-talk captures
   * on the same path, supplied adequate spoken SNR, and kept transport and
   * network valid; it still reached only 0.888 similarity and -7.50 dB
   * residual. A corrected NS run measured two matched-path Mac-only captures at
   * 0.982 similarity / -15.46 dB residual. During double-talk it retained 0.901
   * similarity / -8.69 dB and Grok transcribed the intended nearby utterance
   * exactly. That is bounded damage, not erased near speech.
   *
   * The tempting alternative was the upstream AEC tap: its long, pre-warmed
   * physical matrix looked excellent (0.909 double-talk similarity and about
   * -47 dB far residue). A fresh production-shaped run falsified that choice.
   * The first short reply leaked through the AEC tap nearly unchanged, server
   * VAD opened a second turn, and Grok transcribed its own exact words, "How can
   * I help?". The first measured playback windows also showed raw and processed
   * peaks of the same order, identifying an onset/convergence problem that the
   * settled matrix could not expose. Both of those runs measured a tap with
   * no loss control in front of a userspace gain that had none either, which
   * is the arrangement being removed; they are kept because the AEC-tap
   * onset/convergence observation is still a real thing to watch for, not
   * because either verdict still selects a stage.
   *
   * This is deliberately guarded by the physical oracle rather than assumed
   * from the tap name. `aec.setStage` moves this tap at runtime, so the
   * comparison is a measurement and not a rebuild: `voicelab aec --stages`
   * walks 1/2/3/4 through the same four windows and reads raw-versus-cancelled
   * off the board at each. Reject AGC here if it erases or materially changes
   * nearby speech, or if far-only leakage opens any provider turn. What must
   * NOT come back if it disappoints is the userspace replacement — a fixed
   * make-up gain, a speaker-time duck, or a floor that deletes frames. Those
   * are the three pieces of the stage this line selects, rebuilt blind.
