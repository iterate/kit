/*
 * Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition audio bring-up.
 *
 * PROVEN on donor hardware (branch c-capabilities): this exact topology,
 * register scripting, and boot ordering carried production acceptance runs.
 *
 * Topology: ESP32-S3 -(I2S slave TX, 48 kHz stereo 32-bit)-> XMOS
 * -(I2S master)-> AIC3204. The AIC3204 is a third I2S device on an
 * XMOS-mastered link the ESP32 never sees; its 24.576 MHz MCLK comes from
 * the XMOS, and no MCLK reaches the ESP32 on either bus. Capture is a
 * separate controller (I2S_NUM_1, slave RX, 16 kHz stereo 32-bit) whose two
 * channels are same-time XMOS taps: ch0 = the selected cumulative DSP output
 * (AEC — see voice_pe_hardware_config.c for why not the AGC tap), ch1 = the
 * original microphone (diagnostic only, and the oracle). Both ESP channels
 * are slaves on SEPARATE controllers precisely because one duplex channel
 * pair would force shared BCLK/WS, impossible with two independent clock
 * domains.
 *
 * AEC is hardware, in the XMOS (XCORE-VOICE FFVA, firmware pinned to
 * exactly 1.3.1 and verified at boot). There is no software AEC and no
 * exposed loudspeaker reference, so the composition uses the passthrough
 * processor.
 *
 * Slave-bus traps this file honours (all measured on the donor):
 *  - An unbooted XMOS means no BCLK on either bus and slave I2S blocks
 *    forever: boot fails closed behind the version read.
 *  - `sample_rate_hz` still matters in slave mode — the driver derives its
 *    internal timing from it, and a mismatch is silent data corruption.
 *  - The TX channel is never stopped or reconfigured mid-session: the XMOS
 *    AEC reference rides that stream, and a stopped stream is an AEC outage
 *    that presents as "echo came back".
 *  - `auto_clear_after_cb` on TX, or the DMA ring replays stale audio on
 *    underrun.

   * duck to x1 whenever the speaker was running, a ramp back over sixteen
   * frames, and an absolute floor of 300 with a memset that deleted every
   * frame below it. Those made the gain conditional on the device's own
