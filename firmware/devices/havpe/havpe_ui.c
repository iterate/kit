/*
 * The WS2812 status ring and the one physical button.
 *
 * THIS RING HAS TWELVE LEDS AND THE SHARED LANGUAGE HAS TWELVE LIGHTS. That
 * is not a coincidence — the grammar was designed around this ring — and yet
 * this board spent the consolidation painting all twelve one flat colour,
 * which is why it read as "a sort of white glowy ring" instead of three green
 * for the network, three for the speaker and three for the microphone.
 *
 * So the ring now renders exactly what every screen's status rail renders,
 * pixel for pixel and sector for sector: `conversation_lights` decides the
 * colours, `conversation_overlay` decides whether the whole thing should be
 * breathing because the device is not ready. A person who has learned the
 * lights on the StackChan's screen can read this ring without being told.
