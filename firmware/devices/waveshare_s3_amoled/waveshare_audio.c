/*
 * Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch AMOLED 1.8 audio bring-up (ES8311, full duplex).
 *
 * PROVEN on hardware: a spoken question reaches Grok through this microphone
 * and the answer plays back through this speaker, both over one WebSocket.
 *
 * Recipe distilled from the board's xiaozhi-esp32 port and Waveshare's own
 * BSP:
 *  - I2C0 on SDA 15 / SCL 14; ES8311 at 0x18 (7-bit), AXP2101 at 0x34.
 *  - AXP2101: DC1 = 3.3 V main rail, ALDO1 = 3.3 V microphone rail.
 *  - One duplex I2S channel pair, master, MCLK x256 (the ES8311 driver's
 *    default divider); esp_codec_dev_open() reconfigures slots to mono.
 *  - PA on GPIO46, handled by the ES8311 driver.
 * No TCA9554 pulse here: that expander reset is panel/touch-only.
 *
 * Two tempting bring-up changes are deliberately absent:
 *  - `no_dac_ref` remains false, as in working board ports. The earlier noise
 *    diagnosis was actually two codec instances reconfiguring one I2S pair.
 *  - PGA remains 24 dB. At 30 dB measured speech clipped; the old 36 dB note
 *    described a VAD workaround rather than a safe capture level.
 *
 * The bring-up diagnostics this file once carried (register dumps, a DIN
 * probe) were deleted once the board proved out; git history has them if a
 * future bring-up needs the pattern. Note when reading captured audio off the
 * stream: 640 PCM bytes base64-encode to 854 characters, which is NOT a
 * multiple of 4 — decode each frame separately. Concatenating the strings
 * first misaligns every frame after the first and yields convincing
 * broadband "noise" that looks exactly like a dead microphone.
