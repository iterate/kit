/*
 * Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch AMOLED 1.8 — what makes this board this board.
 *
 * The program it runs is components/voice/src/voice_loop.c, and it is the same
 * program the other three run. What is left here is the hardware: an AMOLED
 * panel with a face on it, two buttons, an ES8311 with a class-D amplifier
 * whose DMA ring this file accounts for, and the twelve health counters those
 * three produce.
 *
 * Turn taking is MANUAL: no VAD anywhere. BOOT toggles the call, PWR is held
 * while speaking. That is a FACT below rather than code, but the reason is
 * physical and belongs with the hardware: this board has no AEC reference, so
 * the only way the speaker is never live into an open microphone is for the
 * microphone to be shut unless somebody is holding it open.
 *
 * Opening the USB console resets this board, which is why `health()` exists
 * and why the stats line is the instrument of record.
