/*
 * The face, on this board.
 *
 * The engine is the shared `avatar` component — the same analyzer, atlases and
 * renderer StackChan uses. This file is only the part that cannot be shared:
 * which task does what, and where the mouth's audio comes from.
 *
 * ================== THREE TASKS, AND ONLY ONE MAY ANALYSE ==================
 *
 * The shared analyzer is a single-writer seqlock, and "single writer" is not a
 * preference: `face_animator_push_pcm` accumulates a 160-sample window in plain
 * non-atomic fields and completes it on `window_fill == window_samples`, an
 * EXACT equality. Two tasks incrementing that counter lose an update sooner or
 * later, the count steps straight past the boundary, and no analysis window
 * ever completes again. The pose then never changes for the life of the boot.
 *
 * That is exactly the fault this file was rebuilt to remove. It was reported as
 * two unrelated complaints — "the mouth stops moving after a few words" and
 * "the speaker dots stay lit when nothing is speaking" — which are one frozen
 * pose seen twice: the renderer draws its mouth and the status bar draws its
 * meter from the same struct. The previous revision pushed PCM from the
 * playback task (`observe_playout`) AND from the app task (`tick`), while its
 * own comment claimed the app task "already owns speaker PCM". It does not;
 * playback_task does.
 *
 * So the tasks are now named, and the split is mechanical rather than trusted:
 *
 *   playback_task  PRODUCER  observe_playout()   writes the ring, nothing else
 *   app_main       CONSUMER  tick(), listening   the ONLY caller of the analyzer
 *   LVGL           READER    render(), level     snapshots, never writes
 *
 * There is no lock. A single-producer/single-consumer ring is what carries
 * audio across the task boundary, and the analyzer sits entirely on one side
 * of it. A future call to the analyzer from the wrong task is a bug this
 * comment can at least name, where the previous design made it look ordinary.

 * the mouth lead the voice by however much audio happens to be queued, which is
 * the one failure the shared engine's contract calls out by name.

 * flushed to the analyzer: nobody heard them, so they must not move a mouth.
 *
 * Only the consumer may move the ring's read cursor, so this does not empty the
 * ring itself — it raises a flag the next `tick` acts on. Anything the producer
 * writes in that window is dropped along with it, which is correct: an abandon
 * is followed by a re-prime, so those samples are the discarded tail anyway.

 * positions in each answer — and the envelope analyzer's guesses are gated
 * off. There is deliberately NO local fallback: an answer with no viseme
 * events plays with a resting mouth rather than an amplitude-flapping one.
 *
 * Everything below runs on the APP TASK (the voicelab callbacks and the tick
 * both live there), so the bookkeeping needs no atomics; the only values that
 * cross tasks are the ones already inside the shared animator's seqlock.
