/*
 * cli_wav: reads the microphone from a WAV file and writes what the speaker
 * played to another.
 *
 * The sink is the closest thing this rig has to a witness. It must record the
 * TRUE playback timeline — silence written where the device concealed a hole,
 * at the moment it concealed it — because a recording that concatenates only
 * successful writes makes a stuttering device sound perfect. That mistake has
 * already hidden this exact defect once: a device inserting 160 ms of silence
 * forty-five times a minute produced a recording a listener would call clean.
 *
 * Only 16 kHz mono PCM16 is accepted, which is the device's format and not a
 * simplification: resampling here would silently change the thing under test.
