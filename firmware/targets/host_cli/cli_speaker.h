 * cli_speaker: the queue between "a frame arrived" and "a frame was heard".
 *
 * It owns a byte ring and nothing else about audio. WHEN a queued frame is
 * due is iterate_kit_voice_playback_clock's decision. Keeping the two apart is
 * what makes each testable, and it is the arrangement the device uses — a host
 * copy of either policy would prove nothing about the device.
 *
 * The ring is sized from the shared profile, so the CLI cannot quietly hold
 * more audio than the board does.
