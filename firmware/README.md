# Iterate Kit firmware

Every ESP board and the host CLI use the same GPT-Live-1 stream. A board owns
physical audio, controls and display; shared components own the conversation.
The backend owns the OpenAI session and the ordinary Agent. A new board should
therefore be small and mostly data. One `device_name` means one client path,
one voice stream and no per-board model choice.

## Where code belongs

| Path                        | Owns                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `components/core`           | Cap’n Web, stream protocol, PCM framing, microphone flush and playout state |
| `components/audio`          | PCM conversion, AEC processing and audio accounting                         |
| `components/voice`          | activation, continuous capture and ESP task coordination                    |
| `platforms/iterate_esp_idf` | Wi-Fi, ESP-IDF, codec tasks and provisioning                                |
| `devices/<board>`           | board-only pins, codecs, display and DSP facts                              |
| `targets/<board>`           | target composition, partitions and SDK defaults                             |

Do not fork the voice loop for a board. All clients capture before the stream
mounts, retain opening audio, flush the first PCM immediately when ready, and
continue capture through a call. Mute and end discard queued PCM. GPT-Live
handles turn-taking; no board needs push-to-talk because it lacks AEC. Preserve
existing AEC/reference routing and prove room echo and barge-in on the hardware.

## Minimum viable board

Start with `devices/satellite1/satellite1_device.c` for a table board or the
closest existing codec. The table type is
`platforms/iterate_esp_idf/components/board/include/iterate/kit/platforms/board.h`.
A minimum board has a microphone, speaker and one activation button. A wake
word is optional. It does not need AEC, a display or a custom board table: use
the shared loop and a small device implementation unless the hardware facts
need a table. A normal table board needs only:

1. `devices/<board>/<board>_device.c` — `struct iterate_kit_board`, hardware-only
   callbacks and `app_main()`.
2. `devices/<board>/CMakeLists.txt` — that code and direct dependencies.
3. `targets/<board>/CMakeLists.txt` — common components plus the device.
4. `targets/<board>/sdkconfig.defaults` — chip, flash, PSRAM, partition and
   wake-model settings specific to this target.

Put GPIO/I2C/I2S facts, boot/reset order, codec register scripts, volume,
physical controls, chimes and wake-word model in the table. Add code only where
a table cannot describe it: codec initialization with required ordering, an
unusual volume register, or a real board extension such as a display BSP.
Reuse the shared I2S codec, session grammar, LED ring, playout and health path.

Confirm from vendor source, then measure: microphone slot and sample shape,
clock master/MCLK, GPIO polarity, amplifier polarity, gain, DMA sizes, and AEC
reference. Give a new board a stable `facts.device_name`; firmware derives its
client `/clients/<device_name>` and voice stream
`/agents/voice/v23/<device_name>` from it.

Register the board once in `apps/kit/src/firmware/catalog.ts`: device identity,
ESP-IDF target, chip and flash plan, including its configuration partition.
Use the target's partition CSV and generated `flasher_args.json` to establish
those offsets. The release builder checks them against the actual binary
partition table. Provide its checked-in chime assets if it uses them. The browser
selector, release builder and `voicelab boards` all consume the catalog; none
needs a separate board registration.

## Build and provision

Install ESP-IDF and build from the target directory. Use a fresh generated SDK
config after changing defaults or partitions:

```sh
cd apps/kit/firmware/targets/<board>
idf.py -B /tmp/iterate-kit-<board> -D IDF_TARGET=esp32s3 \
  -D SDKCONFIG=/tmp/iterate-kit-<board>.sdkconfig build
```

Run shared checks from `apps/kit`:

```sh
pnpm firmware:test:host
```

Kit Flasher prepares the project before it enables USB install: it installs this
Kit build's isolated VoiceAgent guest, verifies `/secrets/openai`, and creates
or verifies `/agents/voice/v23/<device_name>`. It returns the canonical project
ID and stream before flashing. The browser then writes Wi-Fi, OS URL, canonical project
ID and project API key into the versioned `iterate_kit` partition on the
connected board. Credentials never enter the Kit worker or a URL.

At boot, firmware rejects a missing or invalid partition, joins Wi-Fi,
authenticates with the project key and mounts `/clients/<device_name>`. Health
classifies provisioning, Wi-Fi/authentication, mount and audio failures.

## Release and proof

Kit releases are built from this checkout. With ESP-IDF active, run from
`apps/kit`:

```sh
source "$IDF_PATH/export.sh"
pnpm firmware:release
pnpm firmware:sync
```

`firmware:release` builds all five reviewed catalogue targets into a
fingerprinted cache, checks their ESP-IDF flash plans and configuration
partitions, then records a hash for every part. `firmware:sync` only publishes
that current cache as hashed ESP Web Tools parts and manifests. Do not edit
release offsets by hand or substitute downloaded binaries.

The two reviewed UI WAVs are committed once. CMake deterministically converts
them into each component build directory with the board's recorded trim and
gain; generated C arrays are never committed and release builds need no audio
service, secret or network access.

Prove code before publishing a release:

```sh
pnpm --dir apps/kit firmware:test:host
cd apps/kit/firmware/targets/<board> && idf.py build
```

Then use a provisioned, idle board for the air-path proof:

```sh
doppler run --config <environment> -- pnpm --dir apps/os cli voicelab boards \
  --project <project> --only <device-name-or-/clients/path>
```

`voicelab boards` talks through real air and hangs up afterward; do not run it
while someone is using the board. Inspect health before and after. A serial
monitor can reboot a board, so use stream health for in-call observation.
