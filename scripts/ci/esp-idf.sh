# ESP-IDF for Kit Firmware's build legs (.depot/workflows/kit-firmware.yml). This file is the pin, and
# its hash, with python3's version, keys the ESP-IDF that Depot Cache holds for the legs.
# Moved from iterate's monorepo (scripts/ci/esp-idf.sh at iterate/iterate@a5a07e8) with Kit.
#
#   esp-idf.sh key      That key, as a step output ($GITHUB_OUTPUT).
#   esp-idf.sh ensure   Use the ESP-IDF the leg restored from Depot Cache when its receipt holds that
#                       key, downloading nothing. Otherwise warn, then clone the pin into
#                       $IDF_PATH, install its tools and Python environment into $IDF_TOOLS_PATH from
#                       GitHub, dl.espressif.com and PyPI, and write the receipt: only while Depot
#                       Cache holds none for the key, on a pull request that changes this file or on
#                       main until a leg saves one. Hands IDF_PATH and IDF_TOOLS_PATH to later steps
#                       ($GITHUB_ENV).
